# Legacy Thumbnail

| Command            | Argument Type 
|--------------------|--------------
| `legacy_thumbnail` | `<width>x<height>`

This command is similar to `thumbnail` and `resize` but it will crop the image to the
width and height from the center of the image.

This command is the equivalent to running `gravity/center/resize/<width>x<height>^/crop/<width>x<height>+0+0`.
