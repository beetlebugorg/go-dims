# go-dims

Go port of mod-dims.

This port:

    - runs as a standalone service
    - does not require Apache httpd
    - does not implement local filesystem access
    - does not honor timestamp expiration
    - aims to be backward compatible with the `/dims4/` version of mod-dims
    - uses Imagemagick 7.x
