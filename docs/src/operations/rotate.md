# Rotate

| Command       | Argument Type 
|---------------|--------------
| `rotate`      | `float` (degrees)

This command will rotate an image.

This should be a value between 0 and 360. You can provide decimal places, like `25.75`, but
for web use cases I can't imagine anyone is going to notice.

The default rotation is clockwise. Use negative numbers to rotate counter-clockwise.
