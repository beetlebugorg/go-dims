# Getting Started

## Running with Docker

For most use cases it's probably best to stick with the containers to avoid managing Imagemagick.
Many Linux distributions only distribute Imagemagick 6, and go-dims requires Imagemagick 7.

Execute the following to run in development mode on port 8080:

```shell
$ docker run -e DIMS_SIGNING_KEY=devmode -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/beetlebugorg/go-dims serve --dev
```

Development mode will disable signature verification so the signing key doesn't really matter, but
it's still required.

You should have dims running now:

```
‚ùØ curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/dims-status
ALIVE
```

If everything is working you should see a thumbnail below (after refreshing). If you see alt text,
make sure dims is started.

## Compiling from source

If you tried to compile mod-dims, go-dims' predecessor, circa 2009 or so it was painful. Things got
better over time with containers and autoconf improvements but it was never _easy_. The process got
a lot easier with go-dims.

Ok, even mod-dims was easy with containers we just never distributed them. With go-dims
we now have pre-built container images. Our containers include custom builds of
Imagemagick 7, libtiff, and libwebp.

You may still need to compile Imagemagick or one of its dependencies but these days
you can get almost everything you need to compile it on macOS using brew:

```shell
$ brew install imagemagick
```

On Linux you'll need to find an Imagemagick 7 package or compile it from source. It's not hard to
compile, it just takes a while. Check out our the
[Dockerfile.buildimage](https://github.com/beetlebugorg/go-dims/blob/main/Dockerfile.buildimage) to
see how we compile Imagemagick.

Then you can compile and run go-dims:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/beetlebugorg/go-dims.git
$ cd go-dims
$ go build cmd/dims/main.go
$ DIMS_SIGNING_KEY=devmode ./build/bin/dims serve --dev
```
